## ABOUT

Begin by dragging and dropping an image from your computer. Draw on the image, crop it, and resize it before saving it to your computer.
Users can choose to draw over the image using predefined forms such as circles, rectangles, and lines, or they can draw freely. Change the image size while maintaining the aspect ratio, or crop it to remove undesired sections. Filters like Grayscale, Threshold, Sephia, and Invert Colors can be used.
